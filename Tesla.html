<p>
    Tesla, Inc. (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə[b]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company headquartered in Austin,
     Texas. Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles (electric cars and trucks),
      battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. 
      Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and remains the world's most valuable automaker with a market 
      capitalization of more than US$840 billion. In 2021, the company had the most worldwide sales of battery electric 
      vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 21% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market and 14% of
       the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids). Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is 
       a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers 
       of battery energy storage systems, with 3.99 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2021.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
    The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.
    Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively.Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car manufacturer 
    that is also a technology company",with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary 
    motor".Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.In February 2004, the company raised $7.5 million in series 
    A funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. 
    Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.
A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.
